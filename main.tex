\section*{About this paperwork}
This paperwork has been produced by referring to the following sources:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Understanding Cryptography, A Textbook for Students and Practitioners} [C. Paar, J. Pelzl];
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Some sections of this paperwork have been written by either copying or slightly modifying the corresponding sections of the book. Hence, \textcolor{red}{I do not own the content of any of these sections and all rights are reserved to the authors of the book};
        \item This paperwork only covers the main topics that have been included in the Cryptography exams at the Politecnico di Torino so far. Hence, this work doesn't give you a complete and detailed overview about Cryptography. If you want to learn something more about this amazing subject, \textcolor{red}{I highly suggest you to buy the official release of the book};
    \end{itemize}
    \item Wikipedia: mainly for Chinese Reminder Theorem (CRT) and quadratic residues;
    \item Overheads of the Cryptography course (2022-23);
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Missing Topics}
The following topics are not discussed in this paperwork, since the corresponding exercises are quite easy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Feistel networks and DES;
\end{itemize}
Please, refer to the \doublequotes{Holy Crypto Bible} for the solutions. \textcolor{red}{For further explanations, refer to the book}.

\subsection*{Adopted Notation}
I adopted the same notation as the one used by the authors of
\begin{center}
    \textit{Understanding Cryptography, A Textbook for Students and Practitioners} [C. Paar, J. Pelzl]
\end{center}
Hence, most of the letters and symbols used in the overheads of the Cryptography course (2022-23) differ from the ones used in this work.\\\\
For what concerns modular arithmetic and, mainly, modular equations, the following conventions have been adopted:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the modulus$\pmod m$ of the equation is reported at the end of the equation itself, next to the result;
    \item the equality symbol $(=)$ is used when we're making calculations without applying the modulo operator, e.g., when we are re-writing an equation in a simpler (or just more elegant) way;
    \item the equivalence symbol $(\equiv)$ is used when we're making calculations by applying the modulo operator;
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Warnings}
This paperwork may contain errors and/or inaccuracies. Hence, by referring to this paperwork, you are taking into account the possibility of assimilating wrong/misleading concepts and information.
