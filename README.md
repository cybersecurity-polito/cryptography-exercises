# About this paperwork

This paperwork has been produced by referring to the following sources:

- _Understanding Cryptography, A Textbook for Students and Practitioners_ [C. Paar, J. Pelzl]:

  - Some sections of this paperwork have been written by either copying or slightly modifying the corresponding sections of the book. Hence, I do not own the content of any of these sections and all rights are reserved to the authors of the book.
  - This paperwork only covers the main topics that have been included in the Cryptography exams at the Politecnico di Torino so far. Hence, this work doesn’t give you a complete and detailed overview about Cryptography. If you want to learn something more about this amazing subject, I highly suggest you to buy the official release of the book.

- Wikipedia: mainly for Chinese Reminder Theorem (CRT) and quadratic residues.

- Overheads of the Cryptography course (2022-23).

### Missing Topics

The following topics are not discussed in this paperwork, since the corresponding exercises are quite easy:

- Feistel networks and DES.

Please, refer to the “Holy Crypto Bible” for the solutions. For further explanations, refer to the book.
